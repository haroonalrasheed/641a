I am a technology policy expert specializing in cybersecurity, privacy, and digital identity. In 2018 I joined the Tilburg Law School in the Netherlands as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Data Governance on the [Global Data Justice project](https://globaldatajustice.org).

My research interests include cyber policy, critical infrastructure protection, surveillance, biometrics, technology regulation, cybersecurity in the financial services sector, and data in development and humanitarian contexts. I am particularly interested in exploring these topics across the Global South.

My recent publications include a [book chapter on cyber governance in the financial services sector](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ybqgm) and an [article on the surveillance of mobile money platforms](https://doi.org/10.24908/ss.v17i1/2.12924). In 2016 I co-organized a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/african-studies-review/article/div-classtitleintroductiondiv/788C8F5BED1FE9AD46FC2D6613E23160" target="_blank">special forum on surveillance in Africa</a> for the African Studies Review.

Prior to joining Tilburg Law School, I was a Vice President of Cyber Policy at JPMorgan Chase in New York from 2015-2018. I have also worked in tech policy roles at the OECD, European Commission's Joint Research Centre, Vodafone Group, and <a href="http://sixfouronea.net/professional-history/" target="_blank"> elsewhere</a>.

I am consultant on connectivity topics to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and an Oxford Martin Associate at the University of Oxford's Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre. I have a PhD in Information Systems and Innovation from the London School of Economics and Political Science, where I studied biometrics from 2006-2011.
