I am a tech policy expert specializing in cybersecurity, privacy, and digital identity. In 2022 I joined the Faculty of Law at Maastricht University to lead a [new initiative on humanitarian action](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/ecpc/humanitarian-action-programme) based at the European Centre on Privacy and Cybersecurity. I am also a member of the [Global Data Justice project](https://globaldatajustice.org) at the Tilburg Institute for Law, Technology, and Society, having been a postdoctoral researcher on the project since 2018.

My research interests include data governance in development and humanitarian contexts, cyber policy, critical infrastructure protection, surveillance, biometrics, technology regulation, and cybersecurity in the financial services sector. I am particularly interested in exploring these topics across the Global South.

My recent publications include a [collaborative forum](https://doi.org/10.1080/14650045.2022.2047468) on digitization and soverignty in humanitarian space, a [short piece](https://doi.org/10.24908/ss.v19i1.14547) exploring the rise of India’s Aadhaar as an exemplar of developmental digital identity, a [co-authored commentary](https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517211006744) on digital identity research in humanitarian aid, a [research essay](https://doi.org/10.1080/02681102.2020.1811943) written with Professor Linnet Taylor on the impacts of customer identification requirements on refugees, and an [article](https://doi.org/10.24908/ss.v17i1/2.12924) on the surveillance of mobile money platforms.

Prior to returning to academia, I was a Vice President of Cyber Policy at JPMorgan Chase in New York from 2015-2018. Before that I worked in tech policy roles at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), European Commission's Joint Research Centre, Vodafone Group, and [elsewhere](http://sixfouronea.net/professional-history/). I have lectured internationally including at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), Cornell Tech, NYU Stern, and Fundação Getulio Vargas.

I am consultant on connectivity topics to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). I have a PhD in Information Systems and Innovation from the LSE, where I studied biometrics.
