I'm an **Assistant Professor** of Media Studies and Data Science (joint appointment) at the **University of Virginia**, with a background in tech policy, cybersecurity, privacy, and digital identity. At UVA, I teach courses on data ethics, tech regulation, and media policy.

My **research interests** include data governance in development and humanitarian contexts, critical infrastructure protection, surveillance, and biometrics. I'm particularly interested in exploring these topics across the Global South.

My most recent **publications** include a [chapter on 'connectivity as aid'](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/handbook-on-data-protection-in-humanitarian-action/connectivity-as-aid/53154B65F025BA904CAC05B7454DE579) with the UN Refugee Agency's John Warnes for the [Handbook on Data Protection in Humanitarian Action](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/handbook-on-data-protection-in-humanitarian-action/025CE3DFD1FAD908DD1412C20E49F955) (Cambridge University Press). I'm also a co-editor of a [forthcoming special issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/special-issue/10GQ4C3726J) on cybersecurity regulation in the European Union.

Prior to joining UVA, I was based at Maastricht University's European Centre on Privacy and Cybersecurity; from 2018-2023, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow on the European Research Council-funded Global Data Justice project at the Tilburg Institute for Law, Technology, and Society in the Netherlands. Before returning to academia, I developed a tech policy **career**. I was a Vice President of Cyber Policy at JPMorgan Chase in New York from 2015-2018. Before that I worked in tech policy roles at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), European Commission's Joint Research Centre, Vodafone Group, and [elsewhere](http://sixfouronea.net/professional-history/). I've also **lectured** internationally including at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), Cornell Tech, NYU Stern, and Fundação Getulio Vargas.

In recent years I've **advised** the UN Refugee Agency on digital connectivity topics, the GSMA Mobile for Development initiative on its data ethics strategy, and the World Bank on data governance in foundational identity programs. I've also led an international project on data protection regulatory convergence for the European Commission. 

I earned a **PhD** in Information Systems and Innovation from the LSE, where I studied biometrics.
