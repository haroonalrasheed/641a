I am a technology policy expert specializing in cybersecurity, privacy, and digital identity. In 2018 I joined the Tilburg Law School in the Netherlands as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Data Governance on the [Global Data Justice project](https://globaldatajustice.org).

My research interests include cyber policy, critical infrastructure protection, surveillance, biometrics, technology regulation, cybersecurity in the financial services sector, and data in development and humanitarian contexts. I am particularly interested in exploring these topics across the Global South.

In 2020 I co-edited an open-access book on data justice and COVID-19 published by [Meatspace Press](https://meatspacepress.com). My recent journal publications include a [piece](https://doi.org/10.24908/ss.v19i1.14547) exploring the rise of India’s Aadhaar as an exemplar of developmental digital identity, a [research essay](https://doi.org/10.1080/02681102.2020.1811943) on the impacts of customer identification requirements on refugees, a [note](https://doi.org/10.1111/1758-5899.12729) on the use of regulatory sandboxes to stimulate responsible humanitarian innovation, and an [article](https://doi.org/10.24908/ss.v17i1/2.12924) on the surveillance of mobile money platforms.

Prior to joining Tilburg Law School, I was a Vice President of Cyber Policy at JPMorgan Chase in New York from 2015-2018. Before that I worked in tech policy roles at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), European Commission's Joint Research Centre, Vodafone Group, and [elsewhere](http://sixfouronea.net/professional-history/). I have lectured internationally including at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), Cornell Tech, NYU Stern, and Fundação Getulio Vargas.

I am consultant on connectivity topics to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). I have a PhD in Information Systems and Innovation from the LSE, where I studied biometrics from 2006-2011.
