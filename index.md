I'm an **Assistant Professor** of Media Studies and Data Science (joint appointment) at the **University of Virginia**, with a background in tech policy, cybersecurity, privacy, and digital identity. At UVA, I teach courses on data ethics, tech regulation, and media policy.

My **research interests** include data governance in development and humanitarian contexts, critical infrastructure protection, surveillance, and biometrics.

My recent **publications** include a [research article on humanitarian data sovereignty](https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517251361109) and a [co-authored paper on AI governance and data justice](https://doi.org/10.1177/29768640241306800).

Prior to joining UVA, I was based at Maastricht University's European Centre on Privacy and Cybersecurity; from 2018-2023, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Tilburg Institute for Law, Technology, and Society in the Netherlands. Before returning to academia, I developed a tech policy **career**. I was a Vice President of Cyber Policy at JPMorgan Chase in New York from 2015-2018. Before that I worked in tech policy roles at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), European Commission's Joint Research Centre, Vodafone Group, and [elsewhere](http://sixfouronea.net/professional-history/). I've also **lectured** internationally including at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), Cornell Tech, NYU Stern, and Fundação Getulio Vargas.

In the past I've **advised** the UN Refugee Agency on digital connectivity topics, the GSMA Mobile for Development initiative on its data ethics strategy, and the World Bank on data governance in foundational identity programs. I've also led an international project on data protection regulatory convergence for the European Commission. 

I earned a **PhD** in Information Systems and Innovation from the LSE, where I studied biometrics.
