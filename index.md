I am a technology policy expert specializing in cybersecurity, privacy, and digital identity. In 2018 I joined the Tilburg Law School in the Netherlands as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Data Governance on the [Global Data Justice project](https://globaldatajustice.org).

My research interests include cyber policy, critical infrastructure protection, surveillance, biometrics, technology regulation, cybersecurity in the financial services sector, and data in development and humanitarian contexts. I am particularly interested in exploring these topics across the Global South.

My recent publications include a [book chapter on cyber governance in the financial services sector](/CyberGovernanceFSS.pdf) and an [article on the surveillance of mobile money platforms](https://doi.org/10.24908/ss.v17i1/2.12924). In 2016 I co-organized a [special forum on surveillance in Africa](
https://doi.org/10.1017/asr.2016.35) for the _African Studies Review_.

Prior to joining Tilburg Law School, I was a Vice President of Cyber Policy at JPMorgan Chase in New York from 2015-2018. I have also worked in tech policy roles at the OECD, European Commission's Joint Research Centre, Vodafone Group, and [elsewhere](http://sixfouronea.net/professional-history/).

I am consultant on connectivity topics to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and an Oxford Martin Associate at the University of Oxford's Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre. I am also the Managing Editor of the newly launched open-access journal, [_Technology and Regulation_](http://techreg.org). I have a PhD in Information Systems and Innovation from the London School of Economics and Political Science, where I studied biometrics from 2006-2011.
