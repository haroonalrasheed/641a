## Peer Review

I have reviewed research articles for many academic journals and conferences, including Management Information Systems Quarterly, European Journal of Information Systems, Public Understanding of Science, Information Technology & People, Journal of Information Technology, Journal of Cybersecurity, Biosocieties, Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, IEEE Security & Privacy, Information Technology for Development, Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, Surveillance & Society, Technology & Regulation, Computer Law & Security Review, Finance and Society, British Journal of Political Science, Journal of Refugee Studies, and ACM FAccT, among others.

**_However, I will now only agree to review articles for journals and conferences that are meaningfully committed to open access._**
