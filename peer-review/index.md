## Peer Review

I have reviewed research articles for several academic journals and conferences, including Management Information Systems Quarterly, European Journal of Information Systems, Public Understanding of Science, Information Technology & People, Journal of Information Technology, Biosocieties, Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, IEEE Security & Privacy, Information Technology for Development, Surveillance & Society, Technology & Regulation, British Journal of Political Science, and ACM FAT*. **_However, I will now only agree to review articles for journals and conferences that are committed to open access._**
